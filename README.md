## Stable vs Dev build

The stable build will usually crash less, and all features should work as intended. The dev build will have beta features, but at times, it might crash.

Stable build: https://resclient.vercel.app/

Development build: https://resclientdev.vercel.app/

FPS Build: https://resclientfps.vercel.app/ (Uses old version of eaglercraft to boost fps, no mods and no texture packs) - Eagler version 22w16
